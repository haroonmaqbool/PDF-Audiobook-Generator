# PDF Audiobook Generator

This Python script converts a PDF file into an audiobook using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. It utilizes the PyPDF2 library to extract text from each page of the PDF and the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech conversion.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pyttsx3
- PyPDF2
- tkinter (for file dialog)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/haroonmaqbool/pdf-audiobook-generator.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pyttsx3 PyPDF2`.

## Usage
1. Run the script `pdf_audiobook_generator.py`.
2. Use the file dialog to select the PDF file you want to convert into an audiobook.
3. The script will start reading the PDF, converting each page into speech.

## Note
- Ensure that your system has Python 3.x installed along with the required dependencies.
- Depending on the length and complexity of the PDF, the conversion process may take some time.
- Make sure your system's audio output is configured correctly to hear the generated speech.
